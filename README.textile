h1. Lifestream

Lifestream is a series of scripts to grab data from places and dump it into a
database.

Lifestream is an AJAX-based box that updates this on a web page in real time.

Lifestream is a wordpress plugin to make that work, too.


h2. How to make it go:

* Use the schema to create a database
* copy dbconfig.ini.example to lose the example bit
* edit it to contain real live database and API details
* install "Python Twitter Tools":http://mike.verdone.ca/twitter/
  * (Either globally, or put a symlink to it's /twitter directory inside imports)
* do the same with "py-github":https://github.com/dustin/py-github if you want to use the github library
* Each import script accepts a username as a parameter
   pipe the output of the script to the database
* eg:  twitter.py [Lifestream "Type"] [Twitter Username]
* You should run each twitter script in the terminal once to generate the OAuth tokens
* Cron this, because typing it every so often is dull.
* The example_twitter.sh includes wrappers to make sure it never runs before the last one finishes, duplicate that.

* Install the web dir somewhere accessible, edit the conn.php file with database stuff
* Edit the wordpress plugin to be able to find it.
* Complain when it doesn't work.
