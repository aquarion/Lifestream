h1. Lifestream

Lifestream is a series of scripts to grab data from places and dump it into a
database.

Lifestream currently runs http://NicholasAvenell.com

Lifestream is an AJAX-based box that updates this on a web page in real time.

Lifestream is a wordpress plugin to make that work, too.

Dayze is a website using all this data.

h2. How to make it go:

* Initialise the submodules (git submodule init)
* Install the Google Python API

* Use the schema to create a database
* copy dbconfig.ini.example to lose the example bit
* edit it to contain real live database and API details
* Each import script accepts a username as a parameter
   pipe the output of the script to the database
* eg:  twitter.py [Lifestream "Type"] [Twitter Username]
* You should run each twitter script in the terminal once to generate the OAuth tokens
* Same for Foursquare and the Google Latitude APIs, if you're using them.
* Cron this, because typing it every so often is dull.
* The example_twitter.sh includes wrappers to make sure it never runs before the last one finishes, duplicate that.

* Install the web dir somewhere accessible
* Edit the wordpress plugin to be able to find it.
* Complain when it doesn't work.
